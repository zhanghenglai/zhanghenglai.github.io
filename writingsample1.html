            <h2>Part I</h2>

            <span class="square"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alfred-Emily-Doris-Lessing/dp/0060834889" target="_blank"><img src="img/lessingbook.png" alt="Cover of Doris Lessing's book, Alfred &amp; Emily." width="150"/></a></span>

            <p>In Season 1, Episode 13 ("The Wheel") of AMC’s <i>Mad Men</i>, Don Draper, played by Jon Hamm, presents his sales pitch for Kodak’s rotating slide projector, the Carousel<sup>1</sup>:</p>

            <blockquote>In Greek, nostalgia literally means the pain in an old wound. It’s a twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn’t a spaceship. It’s a time machine. It goes backwards. Forwards. It takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It’s not called the Wheel. It’s called the Carousel. It lets us travel the way a child travels. Around and around, and back home again&mdash;to a place where know we are loved. (<i>Mad Men</i> 36:13)</blockquote>

            <p>In the previous episode of <i>Mad Men</i> ("Nixon vs. Kennedy"), it’d been revealed to the audience that Don Draper was, in fact, Dick Whitman. A young Whitman met (the real) Draper during the Korean War. Whitman had just started his tour of duty, while (the real) Draper was close to the end of his. Shortly after their meeting, Draper was killed in an explosion that burned his face and body beyond recognition. Whitman switches dog tags with Draper’s corpse, assumes Draper’s identity, and escapes the Korean War. He receives the Purple Heart in the process.</p>

            <p>For much of <i>Mad Men</i>, (Dick Whitman as) Don Draper struggles with the trauma of his childhood, of the Korean War, and of his secret history. He struggles despite the physical and temporal distance he’s placed between himself and his past. Despite having attained success and wealth as a partner and prodigy at Madison Avenue advertising firm Sterling Cooper. Likewise, Doris Lessing in <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i> struggles with the trauma of <i>her</i> childhood, of World War I, and of its lasting impact on her parents. She struggles despite the <i>ninety years</i> that’s passed between the end of World War I in 1918 and the publication of <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i> in 2008. Despite having attained critical acclaim as a writer and winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2007. World War I had left an indelible scar on Lessing’s psyche, which she admits in the foreword to <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i>:</p>

            <blockquote>That war, the Great War, the war that would end all war, squatted over my childhood. The trenches were as present to me as anything I actually saw around me. And here I still am, trying to get out from under the monstrous legacy, trying to get free. (Lessing viii)</blockquote>

            <p><i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i> is part fiction, part memoir. But for her, as is the Kodak Carousel projector is for Don Draper in <i>Mad Men</i>, the book is a kind of time machine. It goes backwards, forwards, to places where Lessing aches to go again, and to places that had caused her heartache in the first place. Lessing is no stranger to the concept of time travel.<sup>2</sup>  If time flowing forward branches into multiple streams of possibilities, then who’s to say that time trickling backward can’t also fracture into disparate histories? Lessing’s choice in using a fiction-memoir hybrid form makes her book particularly potent as a medium for narrative time traveling.</p>

            <p>In "Rewriting the Story, Restorying the Self," &Aacute;ngeles de la Concha recognizes Lessing’s attempt to "organize life retrospectively with the help of fiction… [which] fits in smoothly with the notion of interpretation as a way of self-understanding, as well as the inescapable connection of narrative and time" (Concha 171). In Lessing’s collection of <i>two diverging</i> "pasts", the fictitious past free without World War I helps her reconcile her relationship with and understanding of her parents. This attempt utilizes not only her imaginative faculties as a writer, but also the breadth of her experiences in her old age. The ninety years between World War I and <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i>, rather than blurring memories and dulling recollection, provides Lessing with "a privileged standpoint of the positive, transformative, temporal dimension of the self. Besides avoiding the risk of reducing identity to a single story, refiguring or ‘restorying’ one’s life may bring healing closure to troubling events" (Concha 171).</p>

            <p>In the timeline "that happened", after World War I concluded, Lessing’s family settles in what is present-day Zimbabwe and what was at the time the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.  Lessing, as a child, was obsessed with a trunk of dresses, shoes, and other fashionable clothing Lessing’s mother Emily had brought with her from London. For the longest time, Lessing recalls, she was forbidden from playing with or trying on her mother’s dresses. Emily herself never really had the occasion to wear them either, so they sat&mdash;locked away in the trunk. "But then, one day, just like that, [Lessing’s mother] said yes: some new <i>disappointment</i> must have overtaken [Emily], telling her that, no, she would never wear these frocks, those feathery boas, the brocade shoes, the satin evening cloaks…" (Lessing 201).</p>

            <p>The young Lessing’s astonishment at the glamor of the dresses, in contrast to the dejected tone with which her mother explains each dress, highlights her mother’s despondency with their life on a dusty maize farm in Southern Rhodesia. Lessing describes: "‘I should have put in more mothballs,’ remarked my mother, as dry as you like, almost indifferent, just as if she was not about to see her precious dreams for the frocks disappear into moth holes…" (Lessing 201).</p>

            <p>Then:</p>

            <blockquote>I laid on the floor a sage green lace dress, with long sleeves and, in the front, covering a deep V, a wisp of the palest pink chiffon… ‘A dinner dress,’ murmured my mother. ‘I never actually wore it. It was too formal for the voyage.’ A dinner dress! People wore clothes especially made to eat their dinner in? ‘It’s for a dinner party, you see,’ she remarked, in that offhand voice, dry from keeping the tears at bay. (Lessing 201-202)</blockquote>

            <p>And again:</p>

            <blockquote>And then <i>the frock</i>, the beauty of them all, held up by me so that she could see it. It had the palest grey top, of chiffon, and on the chiffon were traceries of crystal beads…‘Oh, oh,’ I moaned, ‘just look, oh, just look.’ And she did just look, and saw… ‘I’ve never worn it,’ she said. ‘When I saw it hanging there I knew it was my dress. I had to have it, I paid much too much…’ and she put out her hand, a fine, elegant hand, worn with farm work, and stroked it. It was full of moth holes. (Lessing 203)</blockquote>

            <p>And again:</p>

            <blockquote>There was another dress, of fine green linen… But when and where would one wear it? … ‘That’s a garden-party dress.’ A garden party! ‘You know the park in Salisbury? Will, imagine it with English trees, and English shrubs and flowers. There would be music, you see, and a big marquee with tea and refreshments.’ And now she was crying, and wiping her eyes. (Lessing 203-204)</blockquote>

            <p>Finally, Lessing’s mother relinquishes her dress to Lessing&mdash;"You’d better have these,’ she said. ‘You can use them for dressing up. Or cut them up, if you feel like… I don’t care…’ (Lessing 204). She exits the room to, as Lessing imagines, to find a place to cry.</p>

            <p>This heartrending scene, which would’ve occurred over the course of an hour or two, is a poignant analogy for the erosion of Emily’s dreams over the course of many years in Southern Rhodesia. This scene also captures most of the tone of the second, "biographical" half of <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i>, which stands out from the first, fictitious half of the book by the bitterness and brokenness with which Lessing portrays her mother.</p>

            <p>This scene by itself can be received by the reader either in a sympathetic or judgmental light&mdash;either Lessing’s mother is a tragic figure, or a selfish, sullen one. However, the Emily in the "alternate" timeline in which World War I never happened and she never moved to Southern Rhodesia provides an illuminating contrast. <i>That</i> Emily marries the esteemed cardiologist Dr. Martin-White and becomes a prolific and proficient hostess of precisely the dinner parties that the "real" Emily yearned for but never again had the chance to attend:</p>

            <blockquote>The first musical evening was a great success. [Emily] played well… She embarked on a dinner party; he chose the guests. She had some luncheon parties, for the wives of his colleagues… Emily had turned into a socialite… Dr. William Martin-White’s and Mrs. Martin-White’s parties [were] often featured [in the gossip columns]. ‘She’s going in for the Honourable this and Lady that,’ said Daisy. ‘She invited me to a musical do and I was sitting next to our ambassador in in Berlin." (Lessing 57-58)</blockquote>

            <p>Albeit, the Emily of London didn’t feel fulfilled with her role as a hostess and socialite for her husband. After her husband’s death, she channeled her efforts and abilities to continue pursuing an active, rewarding life. She founded a successful chain of charitable Martin-White schools. The Emily of this alternate timeline flourished to the same extent that the Emily of the historical timeline languished, experiencing a reality that’s crushingly different from what she’d hoped for.</p>

            <p>In "The Ethics of Remembering People and the Fact/Value Dichotomy&mdash;Doris Lessing and Iris Murdoch", Nora H&auml;m&auml;l&auml;inen believes "To make room for a sympathetic understanding, the older Lessing provides her mother with both a personal history of disappointment and a historical context of ruined lives" (H&auml;m&auml;l&auml;inen 87). The Lessing who wrote <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i> is less resentful toward, and more understanding of, her mother than the adolescent Lessing whose unhappy childhood was still a fresh wound. The pairing of the fictitious narrative with the fictitious narrative, therefore, is Lessing’s invitation to the reader to interpret Emily’s character more compassionately.</p>

            <p>Another parallel between the Emily of the Rhodesia timeline and the Emily of the London timeline is their mutual love for literature. Following the death of the fictitious Emily’s husband, Dr. Martin-White, she returns to her childhood home in Longerfield and sees all the books of her childhood. The Emily of this alternate timeline never married Alfred or gave birth to Lessing, nor did she have any children of her own with Dr. Martin-White. However, the role of literature in her childhood allows her to become a captivating storyteller to the children of Longerfield. She incorporates literature as a cornerstone of her Martin-White schools and its philosophy for education. Moreover, "Emily went to her chief suppliers, ordered them to send a good selection of children’s books to Longerfield, and went down herself [to deliver these books]" (Lessing 100).<sup>4</sup></p>

            <p>The Emily who marries Alfred and gives birth to Lessing, likewise, shared books with children&mdash;both with Lessing as well as the children of the community: "This stream of books for children came pouring through our house and sometimes out again, for my mother complained, but was pleased about it, that people saw her as a kind of library" (Lessing 165-169). Lessing describes at length the process of procuring this "stream of books":</p>

            <blockquote>This meant laying out on the dining-table the Croxley writing-paper, pens, ink, and she wrote carefully long lists of books. They were addressed to London bookstores, stamped, and the envelope was taken by the boy on his bicycle to the station where it was handed in at the post office…The letter was carried by train to Salisbury, taken to the post officer there, and put on a train to Beira or to Cape Town. A ship took the precious letter to London, England. The letter was read, big brown-paper parcels were made up, tied with thick string, and they were on the ship to Cape Town and Beira. Then the reverse journey… the ‘boy’, or sometimes my mother, would come to collect them. And then the joy of those parcels, spread out on the dining-table, on the spare bed in my room. (Lessing 166)</blockquote>

            <p>The energy with which Emily invests in providing her daughter with these books matches or exceeds the energy with which she herself had treated her dresses&mdash;the death of one dream for the birth of another. In linking the Emily of the London timeline’s talent for storytelling to her childhood immersion in literature, Lessing seems to suggest that, despite whatever shortcomings her own mother had in raising her, the Emily of the Rhodesia timeline at least did this for her daughter. In her writing, Lessing acknowledges and appreciates how her mother’s "stream of books" may have helped cultivate her own literary career.</p>

            <p>Overall, "Lessing’s later perspective is more generous and evaluates ‘the mother’ from the point of view of a longer life experience, not the least the experiences of motherhood and aging" (H&auml;m&auml;l&auml;inen 88). The personal context in which Lessing wrote <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i> helps explain her redemptive, or perhaps mitigating, portrayal of her mother. "Human memory, driven by emotional self-interest, goes to extraordinary lengths to provide evidence to back up whatever understanding of the world we have our hearts set on" (Patrick Duff qtd. in Shields, &sect;164). In Lessing’s case, she invents an entire alternate timeline. But by taking into account the personal hardships that Emily endures as well as the larger, looming backdrop of World War I, Lessing not only comes closer to making peace with her own childhood, but also paints a richer, more nuanced portrait of her family.</p>

            <h2>Part II</h2>

            <span class="square"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boyhood-Patricia-Arquette/dp/B00MEQUNZ0" target="_blank"><img src="img/linklaterfilm.png" alt="Cover of Richard Linklater's film, Boyhood." width="150"/></a></span>

            <p>In contrast, Richard Linklater’s <i>Boyhood</i> provides a similarly ambivalent but ultimately uplifting perspective on growing up without necessarily the benefit of a longer life experience. If <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i> is Homer reciting <i>The Iliad</i>, then <i>Boyhood</i> is perhaps Mount Vesuvius burying Pompeii, both capturing history by unconventional means. Whereas Lessing handles her <i>real</i> childhood from afar and through the lens of <i>fiction</i>, Linklater deals with the <i>fictitious</i> childhood of Mason Evans, Jr. up-close and <i>documentary</i>-style.</p>

            <p>To experience <i>Boyhood</i>, for anyone who was alive from the period depicted in the film , is to experience nostalgia&mdash;that "twinge in [the] heart far more powerful than memory alone" (<i>Mad Men</i> 36:13). Paul Jackson observe in "These Things Take Time" that, "Sometimes, the events depicted [in <i>Boyhood</i>] are significant… often thought, as in real life, they are unremarkable in their everyday normalcy" (Jackson 10-11). The alloying of everyday, mundane, regular moments in life with life’s milestones makes <i>Boyhood</i> function less like a scripted period film (although the film <i>is</i> scripted) about the 2000’s, but more like how our memories actually work. And in this sense, the film is also a potent time machine.</p>

            <p>For example, I have very little recollections of my high school or college graduations. But I do remember vividly moments in the days leading up to and following these milestones. Similarly, Linklater doesn’t show Mason’s high school graduation ceremony, but rather, him driving home after the ceremony with a friend while wearing his graduation gown. He doesn’t show Mason breaking up with his girlfriend, but rather, an argument they have about prom after they had broken up. We never find out who Mason went to prom with, or if he went to prom at all. Mason’s mother, Olivia’s, marriage to (professor) Bill and subsequently to Jim isn’t shown, but the "moments" when the initial flirtation occurs are . The "skipping along" of the camera along Mason’s timeline mimics the patchwork landscape of human memory.</p>

            <p>It’s said that scents trigger memories. Absent that, Linklater effectively utilizes sounds to anchor the viewer in the present. "Linklater told <i>Time</i> magazine that the soundtrack ‘had to be songs of the time’ that could immediately transport viewers back to moments in their lives" (Jackson 12). This "sense of perpetual present… [reflects] Linklater’s recognition of music’s ability to act as a memory trigger" (Jackson 12). Because <i>Boyhood</i> takes place in Texas, there is <i>a lot</i> of driving.  Each driving scene offers both an opportunity for dialogue between the passengers of the car and to play the "songs of the time", which immediately establishes a connection between the viewer’s sense of time and the time depicted in the film. If time travel is to be experience some other point along the timeline as if it were the present, then Linklater achieves this.</p>

            <p>As a genre, <i>Boyhood</i> is a hybrid of film and documentary. If this statement seems to be contradictory, such contradiction is resolved in Justin Chang’s "Time on his Side". Quoting Jacques Rivette, he asserts that "Every film is a documentary of its own making" (Chang 40). Ultimately, <i>Boyhood</i> is a film&mdash;it was written, scripted. But according to Linklater himself:</p>

            <blockquote>I was aiming for reality; I never wanted it to feel written (but it was)… I was always just taking the temperature of these four people where they were at, and where they were going. It was an ongoing collaboration. But the biggest collaborator here, looking back, was time. (Linklater qtd. in Chang 40)</blockquote>

            <p>The documentary aspects of <i>Boyhood</i> are twofold: First, although the film captures the past, this process happens in real time, as the past is being made. <i>Boyhood</i> as a period film is different from, say, <i>Forrest Gump</i> or <i>Mad Men</i> in this sense. The historical events depicted in <i>Forrest Gump</i> and <i>Mad Men</i> are selected for their historical significance, known after the fact. This is an advantage that Linklater didn’t have to work with while he filmed his scenes year after year. There is a kind of documentary-like authenticity&mdash;rawness, perhaps&mdash;to the not-knowing way in which Linklater "captures" the past without the benefit of hindsight.</p>

            <p>For example, Linklater shows Mason Jr. and Sr.’s interaction with a middle-aged white male who wears a cowboy hat and adorns the side of his house with the Confederate flag. He shoos the father-son pair away while disavowing Obama. On the other hand, a younger woman, perhaps in her twenties, is enthusiastic about Obama. Once again, Obama’s victory or even his campaign speeches aren’t depicted in the film. Instead, the <i>personal</i> moment of Mason’s own experience of the election is portrayed. "Linklater is therefore much less concerned with historic events than he is with ordinary lives. In this sense, his ambitions are much more closely aligned with those of a documentarian than with fictional period filmmakers" (Jackson 13).</p>

            <p>The second documentary-like quality of <i>Boyhood</i> is the blurring of the lines between the subject and the story. In the film, Mason (Evans, Jr.) manifests an interest in photography starting in high school. He eventually wins the Silver Medal in a state photography contest and goes off to Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas to study photography. The fictitious life trajectory of Mason in <i>Boyhood</i> was in "direct response to Coltrane’s  own fascination with the medium" (Jackson 15). Of course, Ellar Coltrane the real-life person had been performing in front of the camera for several weeks each year since he was the age of six. This invites the viewer to speculate whether the fictitious character Mason, as a young child in front of the camera, influenced the real-life person Coltrane, as a teenager, to pick up the camera (which in turn, is then incorporated back into the fictitious character Mason, as a teenager). "This overlapping of fact and fiction is, in part, what makes <i>Boyhood</i> such a fascinating film" (Jackson 16).</p>

            <p>Revisiting the theme of time travel, what makes time travel stories most interesting isn’t the historical events that are already known, but how the protagonist experiences the past as present. Moreover, viewers are curious to know the consequences of the protagonist’s actions in the past timeline causes ripples not only to the future timeline, but to themselves.  Linklater himself admits that his genre-defying approach "makes no sense… It never did make sense on paper, and it still doesn’t. Artists get it. Businesspeople glaze over. They’re like, ‘You’re asking me to give money, but I’m not going to see a return for 12 years?’" (Linklater qtd. in Chang 40). But it’s precisely the artistic&mdash;if also counterintuitive&mdash;vision that Linklater had for <i>Boyhood</i> that gave the film its narratively unique qualities.</p>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h2>Part III</h2>

            <p>In <i>Reality Hunger</i>, David Shields asserts that "The novel has always been a mixed form; that’s why it was called <i>novel</i> in the first place. A great deal of realistic documentary, some history, some topographical writing, some barely disguised autobiography have always been part of the novel…" (Shields &sect;35). Both Lessing’s <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i> and Linklater’s <i>Boyhood</i> brings to the table this wonderful <i>novel</i> quality of the mixed form. Such a mixed form&mdash;whether it’s mixing fiction with biography, or mixing period film with documentary&mdash;imparts upon Lessing’s and Linklater’s respective works with the narrative complexity and flexibility of time travel.</p>

            <p>Fundamental attribution bias is, in social psychology, is the tendency for people to explain the behavior of others by <i>attributing</i> them to internal character traits rather than external circumstances.  Had we only read the biographical portion of Lessing’s <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i>, we might’ve been viewed Lessing as a victim of her mother, Emily, rather than both being victims of the broader, more sweeping forces of World War I. Had we only seen the first year or two of <i>Boyhood</i>, we might’ve pegged Mason as the hapless child of a struggling single mother and a deadbeat father. (However, <i>Boyhood</i> treats us to Olivia’s journey from a waitress going to night school, to surviving not one, but two abusive, alcoholic husbands, to becoming a college professor herself.  Mason Jr., who at the beginning of the film was not ready for the responsibilities of fatherhood, eventually trades his Pontiac GTO with a minivan and becomes an actuary&mdash;the occupational equivalent of boring, stable, responsible adulthood if there ever was one.)</p>

            <p>We’re susceptible to fundamental attribution bias in everyday life, perhaps, because our understanding of the world, of other people, and of reality is limited to the present and our narrow firsthand experiences. Likewise, conventional forms of storytelling&mdash;constrained by character and plot that "teaches the reader that life is a coherent, fathomable whole that concludes in neatly wrapped-up revelations" (Lance Olsen qtd. in Shields &sect;319)&mdash;reinforces our susceptibility to fundamental attribution bias. "Life, though&mdash;standing on a street corner, channel surfing, trying to navigate the web or a declining relationship, hearing that a close friend died last night&mdash;flies at us in bright splinters" (Lance Olsen qtd. in Shields &sect;319).</p>

            <p>By traveling through segments of time, as Linklater does in <i>Boyhood</i>, or traveling through alternate timelines, as Lessing does in <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i>, Lessing and Linklater challenges the norms of their crafts. In turn, they shake up the complacent perspectives of their audience, awaking us to the "bright splinters" of living with diabetes in Southern Rhodesia, or having a trunk full of fancy dresses but no dinner parties to attend, of being raised by a single mother in suburban Texas, of growing up with imperfect father figures. What they’ve shown is that, just as, with time, the course of rivers can change, so too, can the feelings attached to memories. And just as time is what makes the vine grow crooked, it makes the wine grow sweet.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>A clip of this scene, 3 minutes and 20 seconds long, can be viewed on YouTube at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpw54Bskk54" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpw54Bskk54.</a></li>
                <li>In addition to <i>Alfred &amp; Emily</i>, Doris Lessing has written science fiction, including the <i>Canopus in Argos</i> series of five science fiction novels as well as the fifth novel, <i>The Four-Gated City</i>, of her <i>Children of Violence</i> series, which depicts a dystopic London in the future when World War III occurs.</li>
                <li>Lessing’s family settles in Southern Rhodesia in 1925. Lessing’s father envisioned an idealized, pastoral lifestyle. However, "the farm was too small to achieve anything in the way of serious profit" (Lessing 174). Her mother attempted to reproduce the Edwardian lifestyle and live "live among ‘nice people’, people of our kind, ‘our class of people’" (Lessing 176). She was unsuccessful. Lessing moved to Salisbury in 1937, and by 1949, she had moved to London.</li>
                <li>Longerfield opened their own school, modeled after the Martin-White schools. However, the Longerfield school couldn’t be accredited as a Martin-White school because they lacked a Montessori teacher.</li>
                <li><i>Boyhood</i> was filmed from 2002 to 2013, during which the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War occurred, as well as George W. Bush’s presidency and Barack Obama’s first term as president. The first <i>Harry Potter</i> film was released in 2001, and the last <i>Harry Potter</i> film was released in 2011. I was in middle school in 2002, and by 2013, had graduated college and was working in Beijing.</li>
                <li>At Mason’s high school graduation party, Mason’s supervisor from the fast food restaurant blatantly flirts with Olivia, inviting the viewers to imaging another mismatched marriage for Olivia, and whether this marriage would end in alcoholism-caused divorce or an unlikely match that somehow works. Linklater’s subtle humor.</li>
                <li>In <i>Boyhood</i>, driving is also figuratively significant as a symbol for freedom and adulthood. For most of the film, Mason rides his mother’s or father’s car to school, to their new house, on camping trips, to the baseball game. He is cargo. Toward the end of the film, Mason drives his own blue pickup truck down a long, empty road across the desert to college.</li>
                <li>Mason Evans, Jr. in <i>Boyhood</i> is played by Ellar Coltrane from the age of six to eighteen.</li>
                <li>For example, the "Grandfather Paradox", in which the time traveler goes back in time to kill their own grandfather. Does he succeed or does he trip on a banana peel at the very instant he’s about to pull the trigger? Would have Coltrane the person ever been interested in photography had not he spent countless hours acting as Mason in front of cameras? The subject and the story in <i>Boyhood</i> chase each other’s tails just as the past does the present in the Grandfather Paradox.</li>
                <li>For example, fundamental attribution bias might lure a professor into wrongly assuming that a student is lazy or apathetic for turning in an assignment late&mdash;when in reality, the student turned in the assignment late because the end of the calendar year meant a significant spike in time commitments from both school <i>and</i> from work converging all at once.</li>
                <li>At one point in the film, Olivia tells a young man who was doing work on her house’s septic line that he was smart and that he should get a college degree. Toward the end of the film, Olivia is having lunch with Mason and his sister. That same young man, who is one of the managers at the restaurant, approaches them and tells Olivia that he’d gotten his Associate’s Degree and was working on his Bachelor’s Degree. One of the most rewarding and feel-good scenes of the film.
