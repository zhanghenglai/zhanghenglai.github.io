            <h2>An Explanatory Overview of China's High Coal Mining Fatality Rate</h2>

        </header>

        <section>

            <h2>Part I</h2>

            <p>The People's Republic of China is the leading producer of coal in the world. In 2006, China produced 2,482 million tons of coal. Compare this with the 990 million coal produced by the United States&mdash;the second largest producer of coal in the world&mdash;that same year (Homer 424). In fact, as Table 1 shows, China produces more coal than the next seven largest coal-producing countries&mdash;the United States, India, Australia, South Africa, Russia, Indonesia, and Poland&mdash;combined (Homer 424).</p>

            <figure class="paperfig">

            </figure>

            <p>China is also the leading consumer of coal in the world. Both China and the United States consume nearly all of the coal they produce domestically. For the United States, 95.5% of the coal produced within the country in 2006 was consumed within the country or added to the country's reserves. This figure was even higher for China, at 97.5% (Homer 424-425). Furthermore, China's coal consumption rate has, like its gross domestic product, been experiencing double-digit increases since the new millennium.</p>

            <p>The high rate of domestic coal consumption in these two countries can be traced to their heavy reliance on coal as a primary source of energy. Coal accounted for approximately 50% of the electricity generation in the United States and 70% of the electricity generation in China for 2006 (Homer 425). Whereas China and the United States are similar in their usage of coal, China exceeds the United States by far when it comes to absolute metrics of production, consumption, and allocation on account of both the scale of China's economy as well as the intensity with which it is expanding. The trends of China's coal production and consumption closely follows that of China's booming economic growth. Coal is, literally, the fuel for China's roaring economic engine.</p>

            <p>However, there is a steep cost to China's coal-fueled economic advance. While China vastly outpaces other countries in the above measures, other metrics show China to be severely behind the United States and the rest of the world in certain aspects of its coal industry. Specifically, China suffers from an extremely poor coal mining safety record. The People's Republic of China's State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS) reported 4,746 deaths from coal mine accidents in 2006 (Homer 426). The <i>China Labor Bulletin</i> calculated a fatality rate of 1.91 deaths per million tons of coal (Homer 426), while Tu Jianjun in "Coal Mining Safety: China's Achilles' Heel" provides a higher rate of 2.04 for the same year (37). It seems that China's share of coal production and consumption in the world is only surpassed by its share of coal mining related deaths: "China still currently accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total coal mine accidents worldwide" (Tu 38).</p>

            <p>These statistics are cause for both optimism and concern. Both the total number of deaths and the rate of deaths in China's coal mines have dropped since 2000. Compare 2006's 4,746 total deaths and 1.91 deaths per million tons of coal to 2000's 5,798 total deaths and 4.95 deaths per million tons of coal (Homer 426). Within just over half a decade, the number of deaths from coal mining accidents in China are down by 1,000&mdash;an almost 20% drop&mdash;and the fatality rate per million tons of coal shrunk by over 61%. While the number and ratio of deaths peaked in 2002 when 6,995 miners died at 5.27 deaths per million tons of coal (Homer 426), the overall picture is one of decreasing number of deaths as well as decreasing rate of fatality.</p>

            <p>The sense of optimism conveyed by these figures, however, is dimmed when viewed in context of the world. During the period from 2000 to 2006, China reported 41,665 deaths in coal mines. In contrast, a total of 235 miners died in coal mine accidents during the same time in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Labor (Homer 426). Where China's fatality rate was 1.91 deaths per million tons of coal in 2006, the United States fatality rate was 0.04 deaths per million tons of coal for the same year (Homer 426). As such, both the total number of deaths in coal mines as well as the rate in which these deaths occurred in the United States was a mere sliver of a fraction of that of China.</p>

            <h2>Part II</h2>

            <p>One explanation for the difference in the fatality rate of coal mining between the United States and China can be found in differences in what types of coal is mined and how the coal is extracted. While 2/3 of the coal produced in the United States in 2005 came from surface mining, this method only accounted for 1/10 of the coal produced in China that year. China have comparatively smaller reserves of sub-bituminous coal and lignite are more likely to be located in shallow coal seams, so most of China's mining operations are further underground (Tu 40-41). China also lacks the advanced technology and investment in most of its factories to burn these lower-quality types of coal, and as such relies on higher-quality bituminous and anthracite coal located deeper underground (Tu 40-41).</p>

            <p>Surface mining is comparatively safer than underground mining for obvious reasons. The main danger of surface mining&mdash;slope failure&mdash;is easier to control than the more serious risks of underground mining (Tu 41). Gas explosions, flooding, and roof collapse require extensive equipment and supervision to prevent&mdash;exactly the things that China's under-invested mines and under-trained workers lack. Unsurprisingly, 54% of coal mine accidents in China for 2008 were caused by gas explosions and another 25% were caused by collapses (Shen, Gao, and Cheng 6-7). The lack of technology in other sectors of China's economy that drive mining operations deeper underground coupled with the lack of technology in these coal mines contribute to highly unsafe conditions in China's mining industry.</p>

            <p>In "Coal Mine Safety Regulation in China and the USA", Andrew W. Homer questions whether it is really "fair" to examine coal mine accident statistics of the two countries at face value given their differences in the level of economic development. He points out that in 2006, the United States gross domestic product was roughly 80% larger than that of China's even while the United States population was almost 80% smaller (Homer 426). Furthermore, gross national income per capita for the United States, ranked fourth in the world, was $44,970 in 2006&mdash;worlds apart from China's $2,010 at 129th place (Homer 426).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, Tim Wright in "The Political Economy of Coal Mine Disasters in China: 'Your Rice Bowl or Your Life'"&mdash;as well as Homer&mdash;point out that China's rate of coal mine accidents and fatalities are not only extremely high in relation to that of developed nations, but also significantly greater than that of even poorer countries. India&mdash;the third largest producer of coal&mdash;has a gross national income per capita of $802, which places it even lower than China at 161st place in the world (Homer 427). China is classified by the World Banks as a "lower middle income" country, while China is categorized as having a worse-off "low income" economy (Homer 427). Despite this, a Chinese official admitted that China's coal mine fatality rates were 15 times higher than India's for 2001 (Wright 629-630). Consistent with, yet despite, the trend of improving safety and lower fatality ration in China's mines, China's 1.91 deaths per million tons of coal was still 6 times that of India's 0.32 deaths per million tons of coal for 2006 (Homer 427).</p>

            <p>In light of China's poor coal mine safety record relative to both developed nations such as the United States and even poorer countries such as India, economic indicators alone fail to provide a full explanation. Homer and Wright alternately propose examining China's economic and industrial development in a historical context. Wright evokes Rene Leboutte, who identified three stages in mining safety based on his study of Belgium's mining industry in "Mortalite par Accident dans les Mines de Charbon en Belgique aux XIXe-XXe Siecles". The first stage is the pre-industrial, labor-intensive phase with little mechanization and small-scale operations, in which accidents were frequent but limited in scope. The second stage consists of the industrialization of the mining industry, which causes both the scale of mining operations as well as the mining fatalities to grow. Finally, social pressure and political attention to increasing death rates, coupled with technological advances, lead to mechanization and improvements in safety. As better safety provisions are implemented and machines take over many of the most dangerous tasks, accident rates fall.</p>

            <p>In this context, Homer suggests that it may be more appropriate to compare China to the United States at an earlier stage of the latter's industrial development. He calculated the fatality to production ratio for America in 1907 to be 6.75, which is comparable to China's 5.27 deaths per million tons of coal in 2002 (427). This would suggest that, despite China's economic growth in recent decades, China still lags behind the United States in terms of the development and maturation of its coal mining industry by almost a century. Underlying the application of Leboutte's three-stage model is the expectation that, in time, China's coal mining safety will improve. SAWS Director Li Yizhoung expressed this sentiment in 2005:</p>

            <blockquote>If one looks at the experience of different countries, and the accident-prone period they endured, the United Kingdom used 70 years, the United States used 60 years, and Japan used 26 years. China's target is to use ten to fifteen years to go through such a period... then to stabilize safety conditions. (Homer 427)</blockquote>

            <p>What differentiates China's current situation, and therefore development track, from that of Belgium or of the United States is, according to Wright, that "China is experiencing all three stages at once" (630). Large State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) mines resemble the "mechanization" stage, while more local and less major state-owned mines are the equivalent of the "industrialization" stage. Furthermore, smaller Township and Village Enterprise mines as well as even smaller, often illegal, coal pits share in the conditions of "pre-industrialization" stage mines. China's growing demand for and persistent reliance on coal to sustain its economic growth, however, does not bode well for China's prospects of calibrating its coal production portfolio to reflect a more modern stage in Leboutte's model.</p>

            <p>The effect of China's mixed sources of coal on the industry's fatality is clearly shown in Table 2. Figures for China's SOE mines, at 1.19 deaths per million tons of coal, while nearly 30 times greater than that of the United States in the same decade-long period, pales in comparison to fatality rates in China's TVE mines. At an astonishing 9.13 deaths per million tons of coal produced, the occurrence of death relative to the production of coal for TVE mines is more than 7 times worse than that of SOE mines and more than 228 times worse than that of United States mines.</p>

            <figure class="paperfig">
                <img src="img/figure2.png" alt="Table of fatality rates in coal mines, China's compared to other countries'."/>
                <figcaption>Table of fatality rates in coal mines, China's compared to other countries' (Wright 631)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Tu Jianjun points out, based on statistics provided by the SAWS Research Centre, that "although TVEs currently produce about one-third of the national coal output, they account for 70 percent of the industry's fatalities" (42). Wright characterizes the fatality levels of TVE mines as "more reminiscent of Belgium in the early 20th century or of Britain in the third quarter of the 19th" (632). It is not farfetched to assert that the presence of TVE mines within China's coal mining industry is weighing down China's efforts to progress along Leboutte's model.</p>

            <p>The attribution of high death rates in China's coal mines to the proliferation and persistence of TVE mines is further supported by structural economic conditions. The expansion of TVEs in the last 1970s applied to the coal mine industry, and small-scale coal mines operated on a local level sprung up throughout the country. These TVE mines not only provided much-needed source of fuel during the energy crisis, but also a source of employment and development for impoverished yet remote localities of China. The energy crisis ended by the late 1990s, "best explained by a general economic slowdown resulting from Asian crises, a decline in output from energy-intensive industries, closures of inefficient state factories and a general increase in end-use efficiency, as well as some substitution for coal by gas" (Andrews-Speed et al. 187).</p>

            <p>China's economic reforms through the rise of the TVE sector and hardening budget constraints had "major implications for the SOEs and their workers, by greatly increasing competition and leading to a long-term decline in profits" (Wright 637). These trends pressured the SOE sector generally and SOE coal mines specifically to move away from the "iron rice bowl" treatment of its workers and to cut the welfare component in worker incomes. Not only that, but it also placed pressures to cut costs across the board, including costs associated with safety.</p>

            <p>Where the emergence of TVE coal mines to meet China's growing energy demands provided no incentive for SOE coal mines to increase spending in safety, the drop in coal prices during the Asian economic slump coupled with competition from the now-existing TVE coal mines provided ample incentive for SOE coal mines to cut safety costs to avoid the claws of hard budget constraints. The subsequent economic upswing did not help with safety either, as the profit-driven pressure in times of high energy demand and rising coal prices motivated all mines&mdash;both SOE and TVE&mdash;to maximize production. In both times of economic downswing and upswing, in the absence of certain social norms and legal liability, the carrots and sticks of business survival and profitability perpetually work to keep safety in the backseat. Specifically, safety measures for China's coal mines were still under-invested by at least 68.9 billion RMB ($8.8 billion USD) for 2006 (Tu 46).</p>

            <p>Toward the end of the 1990s, the premier of the State Council at the time, Li Peng, called for the closing of "all individually licensed mines, all mines involved in illegal sales or license rentals, and mines infringing others" (Shen, Gao, and Cheng 5). The purpose of this order was to reduce coal supply and support coal prices for the benefit of SOE mines, but also with the secondary effect of reducing accidents that occur frequently in TVE and lower-level mines. The central government reportedly closed about 33,000 mines by the end of 1999—most of these were these illegal and "irrational" mines of the TVE sector and smaller-scale operations (Andrews-Speed et al. 187). The central government also issued a circular ordering the suspension of small-scale coal mining operations, except those that had passed inspections and were licensed, in June 13th, 2001. When five coal mine explosions killed more than 100 workers within the span of a week in Shanxi province in November 2001, the government also ordered all small-scale coal mining operations to be suspended.</p>

            <p>These and other attempts to close small-scale, high-fatality coal mines by the central government have been met with resistance, however. Illegal mines are typically located in remote, rural townships where "the mountains are high, and the emperor is far away" (Tu 44). What these illegal mines save in terms of cutting safety equipment costs and labor wages are partly diverted to "soft" investments—regular  "tributes to authorities from the local to the national level" (Homer 435). Pay-offs to safety inspection teams and conflict of interest created by local authorities owning and profiting from a stake in illegal mining operations all contribute to local corruption counteracting national policy. When Beijing required government officials and employees to withdraw their personal investments from local coal mines, many simply transferred their shares to relatives and friends or outright refused.</p>

            <h2>Part III</h2>

            <p>Financial repercussions to mining accidents are even weaker&mdash;prior to 2004, compensation for the death of a miner ranged from just 50,000 RMB ($6,500 USD) to as low as 10,000 RMB ($1,300 USD) (Tu 43). For mine owners, settling matters privately with the families of the victims is not only a viable option, but the rational thing to do over investing in safety practices and equipment. When the government of Shanxi province increased the compensation per coal miner fatality amount to 200,000 RMB ($24,000 USD) in 2005, other provinces followed. However, even this new amount still only accounted for just 1% of the coal industry's gross annual profits (Tu 43) and fails to make any discernible impact to the risk calculus of the mine owners.</p>

            <p>Political pressure, financial costs, and "Even capital punishment is often an insufficient deterrent to greedy officials as the gains at stake are huge" (Tu 44). The profit margin for even a small, but politically-connected, mine can reach 3,000% (Magnier). The imbalance between the deterrents to non-compliance and the overwhelming wealth to be reaped effectively ensures that shirking responsibility and circumventing policy is not only an easily accessible, but highly attractive, alternative to compliance.</p>

            <p>As China's economy continues to expand, as the production of coal is a necessity of this economic growth, and as TVE and illegal coal mines remain a persistent feature in coal production, the capability of coal mines to evade and resist regulation and the vested interest for them to maintain the status quo of poor safety will persist. However high the pay-offs to local authorities may be, however many local officials and mine operators are jailed or executed, and however severe the fines and penalties may be, the stakes are still greater in the race to extract as much wealth from China's economic boom. "This 'gambler's mentality,' experts say, is a common feature these days in the industry and much of the Chinese economy" (Magnier).</p>

            <p>Shutting down the small-scale, least productive, most dangerous of the mines is an obvious and most direct remedy to the high fatality rate in China's coal mines. Given the reasons above, and more reasons that will be provided below, the Chinese government's efforts to close down these "black pits" (Homer 434) have been largely stymied. In fact, despite formal attempts to reduce the number of TVE and lower-level, smaller-scale mines, investigation by the central government reveals that the number of illegal coal mines has actually grown sharply. This can be inferred from official figures from 1998 onward that show rapidly dropping coal production while only modestly dropping coal consumption. "The magnitude of this divergence suggests that coal supplies were drawn from unreported coal production, presumably from TVCMs [Township and Village Coal Mines]" (Andrews-Speed et al. 187).</p>

            <p>Therefore, in conjunction to trimming the ranks of the worst offenders, the Chinese government has also sought to develop a substantial body of law that relates directly and indirectly to TVE mines. However, the ever-changing fluctuations of regulatory agencies as well as legislative bodies&mdash;including major reorganization of government and industry structure in 1993, 1998, and 2001 (Andrews-Speed et al. 191)&mdash;make it difficult for these laws to be effectively enforced. Furthermore, the underlying, fundamental structure of China's government itself hinders effective implementation of policies aimed to address safety issues in the coal mines.</p>

            <p>Kenneth Lieberthal uses the term "matrix muddle" to saliently describe China's government structure of "interlocking and overlapping, vertical and horizontal, lines of authority and reporting (Andrews-Speed et al. 191). The matrix muddle that has persistently and consistently been a source of headache for the Chinese government overall also extends to the Chinese government's attempt to supervise and regulate its coal mining industry. Table 3 depicts a simplified version of how various commissions, industrial agencies, and specialist agencies at central and local government levels are enmeshed together before 1998.</p>

            <figure class="paperfig">
                <img src="img/figure3.png" alt="Diagram of simplified structure of Chinese government before 1998."/>
                <figcaption>Simplified strucutre of Chinese government before 1998 (Andrews-Speed et al. 192)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>First, many horizontal degrees of separation between the policy-formulating agencies at the top and center in Beijing and the policy-implementing administrations at the bottom and periphery in the provinces and localities. This creates a huge margin of error in which policies to be modified and distorted. Policies that address safety issues in coal mines can either be inadequately implemented or conveniently ignored when communication, supervision, and accountability simply falls through the cracks of the matrix.</p>

            <p>Second, numerous and redundant vertical lines of reporting incur onerous and overwhelming burdens on coal mine operators. It is costly, complicated, and time-consuming to satisfy the reporting requirements owed to multiple agencies, so managers of coal mines find it much easier to avoid it altogether. The excess of both vertical and horizontal lines of authority, as well as the large number of agencies dotting this complex web "is almost certain to result in ambiguity, confusion and contradictions in the formulation and implementation of policy for TVCMs [Town and Village Coal Mines]" (Andrews-Speed et al. 194-195).</p>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h2>Part IV</h2>

            <p>However bleak China's coal mining industry in general and TVE coal mining sector in particular may be, the actual conditions of coal mine safety and fatality in China is almost certainly much worse. The Chinese government's practice of covering up and downplaying major accidents causes discrepancies of great magnitude between reported figures and actual deaths in the coal mines of China. In 1960, a methane explosion at the Laobaidong mine in Shanxi province killed 682 workers. The Chinese government classified the accident as a "state secret" and suppressed it for more than three decades until 1992 (Tu 38). While official statistics rest around 5,000 deaths per year, a senior work safety bureaucrat suggest that actual number of deaths may be four times that (Tu 38-39). Note that these figures only account for coal mine deaths caused by mining accidents, and do not include the tens of thousands of workers and locals who die from respiratory and other mining-related diseases.</p>

            <p>In addition to the motivation to "safe face" by the central government, there are even stronger considerations when it comes to the local government for covering up mining accidents. Not only are the income of the coal mine owners and the tax revenue and kickbacks of their friends in the local government at stake, but also the lives of the parties involved are laid out on the table with the pendulum of capital punishment swinging over them. The incentive to cover up mining accidents, and the criminal negligence and corruption that brought about these incidents, are very strong. Coal mine owners and operators collude with officials to withhold and obfuscate information about mining accidents when they occur. Officials routinely falsify death counts and outright deny the events to avoid mine closures, heavy fines, and criminal prosecution, while mine owners buy the silence of the victims' families or compel them through intimidation.</p>

            <p>Local government officials helped coal mine owners cover up the accident that caused the deaths of 81 miners in Nandang county on July 17, 2001. The head of Nandang county had received 3.21 million RMB ($412,000 USD) in bribes in the two years leading up to the accident (Tu 39). In another instance, an underground fire killed 35 miners at the bottom of an illegal coal shaft in Hebei province on July 14, 2008. A cover-up between the owner of the mine and local officials lasted for nearly three months. Before the event was finally leaked on the internet, the mine owner had paid off families of the victims and cremated the bodies of the miners while local officials pretended to investigate and even issued a false report (LaFraniere).</p>

            <p>The emergence and evolution of increasingly independent and proactive journalistic practices play some part in revealing mining accidents and criticizing the conditions that cause mining accidents. News reporters exert pressure on coal mines to follow better safety standards, and contribute to the compliance of central government policies and mandates by acting in the capacity of watchdogs. However, Chinese newspapers tend to focus on emotional post-accident rescue operations and recovery efforts more than in-depth coverage of the collusion and corruption by coal mine bosses and local officials. In addition, some journalists find extortion to be a more lucrative and worthwhile pursuit than whistle-blowing. The July 14 2008 coal mine accident in Hebei province was one such case where journalists received money to stay silent. It was not until someone revealed the incident on an internet chat room in September that the central government was made aware of the accident and subsequent cover-up (LaFraniere).</p>

            <p>Mine owners and local authorities have their own ways of dealing with journalists who try to investigate coal mine accidents and expose the guilty acts of the parties involved. After a serious accident at Muchonggou in Guizhou province in February 2003, local authorities threatened workers not to speak to reporters, used thugs to prevent reporters from accessing the mine site, and forcibly expelled reporters from hospitals where they tried to interview injured miners (Wright 638). The capabilities of journalists to act as advocates for coal mine safety and watchdogs against local protectionism are still developing. There is some ways to go before journalists can reveal coal mine accidents in a timely manner, expose the guilty parties without obstruction, and report the death counts with accuracy.</p>

            <p>Engineers and technicians avoid working in coal mines if they are able to because of the inherent hardships, heightened dangers, and negative reputation of the coal mining industry. This creates a "brain drain" that further hinders the effort to mechanize the mining process and makes sustaining, let alone improving, technological standards and supervisory practices that promote safer working conditions in the coal mines more difficult. In addition to less qualified technical workers, TVE mines also resort to employing local peasants and migrant workers for physical labor I the mines. The short-term contracting of temporary, transitory, uneducated, and untrained laborers account for 80% of underground mining positions (Tu 42). It is little surprise that lack of concern for safety from the management, lack of ability to maintain safety equipment by technicians, and lack of training in, and even awareness, of safety practices in the labor force, results in a high rate of mining accidents.</p>

            <p>Persistent socioeconomic conditions of rural China perpetuate these hiring practices in TVE coal mines. The majority of the workforce for both SOE and TVE mines&mdash;especially the TVE mines&mdash;"come from poverty-stricken rural regions with large numbers of desperate job seekers" (Tu 42) faced with few to no alternatives and possessing little resources. Coal mine managers exploit these vulnerabilities and push these local and migrant laborers&mdash;without adequate training, experience, and equipment&mdash;into working under unsafe conditions for excessive durations. Worker fatigue and incompetency is a deadly mixture that directly contributes to accidents and deaths in the coal mines. To claim that miners are the ultimate reason or a culpable party to the high coal mining fatality rates, however, would be an exercise in victim-blaming.</p>

            <p>Rather, the socioeconomic disadvantages of the rural working class not only make their victimization and exploitation possible, but also drain their ability, even their will, to advocate for better working conditions. The average annual income for mine workers in 2000 was just 12,000 RMB ($1,500 USD) in key state mines and a mere 7,200 RMB ($925 USD) in local state mines. The wages of mine works in TVE coal mines are even lower&mdash;"In some collieries in northwest China, miners were allegedly paid only 1,200 RMB ($155 USD) per year in 2005" (Tu 42). In contrast, the annual salary of experience coal mine workers in the United States can exceed $100,000 USD (Tu 42). The economic and political gap between the social classes that is endemic to Chinese society overall is similarly reflected by this "grave imbalance in the power between those who own or operate China's coal mines and those who work in them" (Tu 43). Whereas government action is ineffectual due to structural defects, citizen action is impossible due to lack of resources and agency.</p>

            <p>Moreover, miners are not only unable, but often unwilling, to fight for the improvement of their working conditions. The title of Wright's article, "Your Rice Bowl or Your Life" comes from an episode of the "Economy Half-Hour" program on <i>China Central Television</i> shortly after a mining disaster in Xuhou in 2001. It concisely sums out the choices—or lack thereof—faced by coal miners. While wages for coal mining is considered extremely low compared to what American miners earn or what coal mine owners and local officials make, workers have few or no alternatives. Marin King Whyte, in "The Changing Role of Workers", describes the situation of China's coal mine workers thusly:</p>

            <blockquote>Two key factors, however, undermine the power of TVE workers to demand improvements in their working conditions: the heavy stress local authorities place on attracting new investment and making local TVEs profitable and the fact that a reserve army of the unemployed exists&mdash;other villagers. Most rural cultivators would prefer Dickensian industrial working conditions to a life of agricultural toil. (Wright 643)</blockquote>

            <p>Regardless of how much disenfranchised mine workers like the idea of improved safety, the harsh socioeconomic reality grounds them from taking any action beyond wishful thinking. To attempt to make any waves on the issue means risking their current income. A <i>TimeAsia</i> article reported, "In desolate places like Guizhou, there is no other way to make money" and quoted a coal miner who said "How can the government close the mines? We need the coal. Everybody does" (Wright 644). Resistance to orders from Beijing to improve mine safety and to close illegal mines, therefore, can not only be found in the greed of mine owners and the corruption of local officials, but also the reluctant acquiescence of the workers themselves. The coal miners of China are not merely victims&mdash;they are victims who are partially complicit in their own suffering, as if they were inflicted by the economic form of Stockholm Syndrome.</p>

            <p>The head of the Lupanshui Mining Bureau, discussing the difficulty in closing down small, illegal mine shafts and coal pits, point out that "The government has its general policies, but for us on the ground we have to deal with the real problems of livelihood, local economy and job creation" (Wright 644). Until impoverished coal mining communities can provide its residents with alternative sources of income and diversified vocational paths, the wholesale dependence on coal mining makes reform infeasible.</p>

            <p>Finally, workers are not only unable and unwilling to press for their rights, but they may also be unaware that it is an option in the first place. Coal mine workers&mdash;many of whom are unskilled and untrained, illiterate and itinerate&mdash;usually do not realize that they have a right&mdash;however limited&mdash;to organize. While workers in China are allowed to unionize under the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, de jure, the ability to form independent trade unions do not actually exist, de facto. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) is the sole national trade union in China, and has been panned as a "front for the Communist Party" (Homer 436). A survey from 2005 indicates that 98% of the union's chairpersons are Chinese Communist Party officials. The <i>China Labour Bulletin</i> argues that, because the union structure in China is non-democratic, even should workers coalesce into unions, such organizations lack legal clout to affect change.</p>

            <p>In contrast, Daniel J. Curran in <i>Dead Laws for Dead Men: The Politics of Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Legislation</i> describes United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) as the "major bargaining agent throughout the coal industry" (Homer 435) for over a century. The UMWA does not hesitate to sue government agencies for failing to implement and enforce coal mining safety laws to a satisfactory degree. The UMWA is instrumental in pushing for coal mining safety legislation in the first place through its powerful and influential lobby in Washington, D.C. The strength and vigor of union presence and action in the United States effectively creates an entirely different dynamic than that of China. In the American coal mining industry, the labor union is a third-party that ensures the government follows through with its policies to maintain acceptable safety standards. Unless China's mine workers can unionize, and to a comparable degree as American unions, Chinese laborers will continue to be disenfranchised and the central government's policies will continue to lack "teeth".</p>

            <p>China has emerged as a major economic power in the 21st Century. However, many aspects of Chinese society still lag far behind the rest of the world. An examination of China's coal mining industry, and its abysmally poor safety record and alarmingly high fatality rate, serves as a prime example that China still has a long way to go. Lieberthal's "matrix muddle" and the "growing pains" from laws, policies, and agencies that are evolving and shifting are internal sources of obstruction to government action. The nascence of the free press and an absence of independent, democratic unions deprive the central government of crucial allies. Class inequality and competition between the TVE and SOE sector push safety concerns on the backburner. These political, economic, and social factors combine to create a situation where greed and corruption are self-reinforcing and self-perpetuating within the China's coal mining industry. Only by addressing the aforementioned issues jointly will safety in the mines improve, and China's coal industry advance.</p>
